# Pointers and Strings

This folder contains C programs focused on understanding and manipulating pointers, arrays, and strings.

## Allowed tools and constraints

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs  
- Compilation on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with flags: `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`  
- All files should end with a new line  
- No global variables allowed  
- No more than 5 functions per file  
- Standard library functions like `printf`, `puts`, etc. are forbidden  
- Allowed to use `_putchar` function only  
- You donâ€™t need to push `_putchar.c` (we will use our own version)  
- Provided `main.c` files are examples only; they are not mandatory to push  
- Function prototypes, including `_putchar`, must be declared in `main.h`  
- Betty coding style must be followed (checked with `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`)  

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, I am expected to understand and explain:

- What pointers are and how to use them  
- What arrays are and how to use them  
- Differences between pointers and arrays  
- How to use strings and manipulate them  
- Variable scope
