# C - Variables, if, else, while

This project helped me understand the basics of variables, conditions (`if`, `else`), loops (`while`), logical and relational operators, and how to use `printf` to display results in C.

## Tasks I completed

| Task # | File Name              | Description                                                   |
|--------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0      | `0-positive_or_negative.c` | Prints if a number is positive, negative, or zero          |
| 1      | `1-last_digit.c`           | Prints the last digit of a random number                   |
| 2      | `2-print_alphabet.c`       | Prints the alphabet in lowercase                           |
| 3      | `3-print_alphabets.c`      | Prints the alphabet in lowercase, then uppercase           |
| 4      | `4-print_alphabt.c`        | Prints the alphabet without `q` and `e`                    |
| 5      | `5-print_numbers.c`        | Prints all single-digit numbers of base 10                 |
| 6      | `6-print_numberz.c`        | Prints digits 0-9 using `putchar` without `printf`         |
| 7      | `7-print_tebahpla.c`       | Prints lowercase alphabet in reverse                       |
| 8      | `8-print_base16.c`         | Prints all hexadecimal numbers (0-9, a-f)                  |
| 9      | `9-print_comb.c`           | Prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers   |

I only used the required functions and followed the constraints of the project (no `scanf`, `getc`, etc.).

## What I was allowed to use

- `man` or `help` on:
  - `ascii`

ðŸ”¸ I was **not allowed** to use:
- `scanf`, `getc`, `getchar`, `EOF`
- `EXIT_SUCCESS`, `time`, `rand`, `srand`, `RAND_MAX`
- `for` loops, `do...while` loops
- Functions

## What I learned

By completing this project, I learned:

- How to use arithmetic and logical (boolean) operators in C
- How relational operators work (`<`, `>`, `==`, `!=`, etc.)
- What values are considered `TRUE` or `FALSE` in C
- How to use `if` and `if...else` statements
- How to write comments in C
- How to declare variables of type `char`, `int`, `unsigned int`
- How to assign and print variables using `printf`
- How to use the `while` loop with variables
- What the ASCII character set is
- What the `-m32` and `-m64` flags do with `gcc`

### Requirements General

- OS: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Compiler: `gcc` with the flags:  
  `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- Editors allowed: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- Each file ends with a new line
- No warnings or errors during compilation
- I did **not** use the `system` function
- Code follows **Betty style** (`betty-style.pl`, `betty-doc.pl`)
- This folder includes its own `README.md`

---

This project helped me practice basic logic and output in C using conditions, loops, and variables. I also got more comfortable with the Betty style and compiling with strict flags.

âœ… This project is part of my training at **Holberton School**.
