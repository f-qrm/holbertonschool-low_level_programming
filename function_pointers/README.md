# Function Pointers

## General

- What are function pointers and how to use them
- What does a function pointer exactly hold
- Where does a function pointer point to in the virtual memory

---

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, with options:  
  `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All your files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the project folder, is mandatory
- Your code should use the Betty style (checked with betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl)
- You are **not allowed to use global variables**
- No more than 5 functions per file
- The only C standard library functions allowed are `malloc`, `free` and `exit`  
  Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, `calloc`, `realloc` etc. is forbidden
- You are allowed to use `_putchar`
- You don’t have to push `_putchar.c`, we will use our own file. If you do, it won’t be taken into account
- The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of `_putchar` should be included in your header file called `function_pointers.h`
- Don’t forget to push your header file
- All your header files should be include guarded
- The provided `main.c` files are examples to test your functions, you don’t have to push them (if you do, they won’t be taken into account). We will use our own `main.c` files at compilation.
