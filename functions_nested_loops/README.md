# functions_nested_loops

This folder contains C programs focused on learning functions and nested loops.

## Allowed tools and constraints

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Compilation on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with flags: `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All files end with a new line
- No global variables allowed
- No more than 5 functions per file
- Standard library functions like `printf`, `puts` are forbidden
- Allowed to use `_putchar` function only
- Function prototypes must be declared in `main.h`
- Betty coding style must be followed (checked with `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, I am expected to understand and explain:

- What nested loops are and how to use them
- What functions are, their declaration vs definition
- What function prototypes are
- Variable scope
- GCC flags used for compilation
- Usage of header files and `#include`
