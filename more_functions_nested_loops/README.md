# more_functions_nested_loops

This folder contains C programs focused on advanced functions and nested loops.

## Allowed tools and constraints

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs  
- Compilation on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with flags: `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`  
- All files end with a new line  
- No global variables allowed  
- No more than 5 functions per file  
- Standard library functions like `printf`, `puts`, etc. are forbidden  
- Allowed to use `_putchar` function only  
- Function prototypes, including `_putchar`, must be declared in `main.h`  
- Betty coding style must be followed (checked with `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`)  
- You donâ€™t need to push `_putchar.c` (we will use our own version)  
- Provided `main.c` files are examples only; they are not mandatory to push  

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, I am expected to understand and explain:

- What nested loops are and how to use them  
- What functions are, their declaration vs definition  
- What function prototypes are  
- Variable scope  
- GCC flags used for compilation  
- Header files and the use of `#include`
