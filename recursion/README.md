# Recursion Project

This folder contains C programs focused on understanding and implementing recursion.

## Allowed editors and compilation

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs  
- Compilation on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with flags: `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`  
- All files should end with a new line  
- Betty coding style must be followed (checked with `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`)  
- No global variables allowed  
- No more than 5 functions per file  
- No loops allowed (for, while, do-while)  
- No static variables allowed  
- Standard library functions like `printf`, `puts`, etc. are forbidden  
- Allowed to use `_putchar` only  
- `_putchar.c` does not need to be pushed (we will use our own version)  
- Provided `main.c` files are examples only; not mandatory to push  
- Function prototypes, including `_putchar`, must be declared in `main.h`  

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, I am expected to understand and explain:

- What recursion is  
- How to implement recursion  
- When it is appropriate to use recursion  
- When it is better to avoid recursion  

## Tasks I completed

| Task Number | Task Name               | File(s)                    | Description                        |
|-------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| 0           | Print string recursively | 0-puts_recursion.c          | Prints a string using recursion   |
| 1           | Print string in reverse  | 1-print_rev_recursion.c     | Prints a string in reverse recursively |
| 2           | String length recursion  | 2-strlen_recursion.c        | Returns length of a string recursively |
| 3           | Factorial               | 3-factorial.c               | Computes factorial of a number recursively |
| 4           | Power                   | 4-pow_recursion.c           | Computes power of a number recursively |
| 5           | Square root             | 5-sqrt_recursion.c          | Computes square root recursively  |
| 6           | Is prime number         | 6-is_prime_number.c         | Checks if a number is prime recursively |

## More Info

- Do not use loops or static variables.  
- Understand that recursion is a function calling itself until it reaches a base case.  
- Recursion is useful for problems that can be broken down into similar subproblems.
