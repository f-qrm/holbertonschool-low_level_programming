# Doubly Linked Lists Project

---

## General

- What is a doubly linked list  
- How to use doubly linked lists  
- Start to look for the right source of information without too much help  

---

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs  
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)  
- All your files should end with a new line  
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory  
- Your code should follow the Betty style (checked with `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`)  
- No global variables allowed  
- No more than 5 functions per file  
- The only allowed C standard library functions are: `malloc`, `free`, `printf`, and `exit`  
- Provided `main.c` files are examples for local testing; you don't have to push them  
- We will use our own `main.c` files during compilation, which might differ from the provided examples  
- All your function prototypes must be declared in a header file named `lists.h`  
- Donâ€™t forget to push your header file  
- All header files must be include guarded

## Additional Notes

- Doubly linked lists allow traversal forwards and backwards via `next` and `prev` pointers.  
- Use dynamic memory management (`malloc`, `free`) carefully to avoid leaks or corruption.  
- Follow Betty style strictly for code consistency and readability.  
- Always protect your header files with include guards to avoid multiple inclusions.  
- Main files provided are just for your convenience, but only your functions and header files will be graded.
